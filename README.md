# FUTURE_DS_02

This repository showcases an interactive and insightful Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker built using Power BI as part of my internship task at Future Interns.

The objective of this project was to analyze how digital advertising campaigns perform across various social media platforms using simulated ad campaign data. The project evaluates impressions, clicks, CTR (%), and ROI across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Twitter, delivering actionable insights through dynamic visuals, slicers and converts raw metrics into meaningful, decision-ready insights.
